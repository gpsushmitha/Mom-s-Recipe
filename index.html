<h2>Instructions-</h2>
    <div class="procedure1"><h4>Soften the butter.</h4>
       <p> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Mix butter, sugars, vanilla, and egg yolk until combined. I go for partially melted, nice and soft butter. I just pop it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds.
Mix the dough together.</p></div>
<div class="procedure2"><h4>Everything all in a little bowl.</h4> Stir in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. When a soft dough has formed, stir in the chocolate chips.It takes all of 90 seconds.
Roll into two jumbo dough balls.Roll the dough into two balls and place on a baking sheet </div>
<div class="procedure1"><h4>You’ll have a little extra for munching, by design. </h4>I like to stick a few bonus chocolate chippers on top of the cookies. Annnnd bake! You can add more chocolate chips to the top of the cookies if you want.</div>
<div class="procedure2"><h4>Bake and Let Them Rest. It’s Only 10 Minutes! You Can Do It!</h4>
These guys are very giant and they’ll be very soft and floppy at first – let them set up for at least 10 minutes for optimal texture!Rest the cookies for a few minutes so they settle down and solidify a bit –  I set a timer for 10-15 minutes and just let them rest right on the pan. At that point they should be able to transfer to a plate, or maybe even held in your hand, for warm, delicious eating on the couch.</div>
<div class="procedure1"><h4>You’re Done! YUM!</h4>
Like, seriously. Yum, yum, yum.</div>
